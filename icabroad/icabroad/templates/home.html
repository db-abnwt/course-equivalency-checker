                You will explore the list of partner universities available for your study abroad application and also
                the courses that had been approved from the previous years. The course equivalency in this database is

                university website for the list of courses offered in the particular semester that you are intended to
                study abroad. Please note that courses are subject to the host university’s availability in each

            <h2>Advantages of being an exchange student</h2>
            <p>
                An exchange student is who, by prior formal arrangement, undertakes short-term study (one term to one
                academic year) at one of the MUIC’s partner universities (under a reciprocal basis). Students will pay
                tuition fee at MUIC for their exchange abroad while tuition fee at the host university will be waived.
                Credits earned during the semester abroad will be transferred to MUIC academic records (subject to the
                result of course equivalency arrangement).
